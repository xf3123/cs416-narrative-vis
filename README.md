Had little to no html/css/js experience coming into the project, however I am proud of what I have created with the amount of time I had spent. Much of the html/css/js code could have been optimized / cleaner but I am okay with it due to my inexperience with html/css/js before this project.

I learned a lot from the Mozilla resources and a lot of the code was me doing trial and error and seeing what would change in VSCode.

If I could redo this project, I would have spent more time looking for a dataset that was more complete and something I was more interested in doing. However, this dataset was good for me to learn html/css/js due to its simplicity.
